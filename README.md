## üåü Key Concepts Explored

### 1. Virtual Machines (VMs)
A VM simulates a computer within your physical machine, allowing you to run isolated operating systems. Using **VirtualBox** to create a Debian VM teaches how hypervisors allocate resources (CPU, RAM, storage) between the host (physical machine) and guest (VM). Key advantages:
- Run multiple OS environments simultaneously
- Safely test configurations without affecting the host
- Efficiently share hardware resources

### 2. LVM (Logical Volume Manager)
LVM abstracts storage management, enabling flexible disk allocation beyond traditional partitioning:

- **Physical Volumes (PVs)**: Raw storage devices (disks or partitions)
- **Volume Groups (VGs)**: Pools of PVs that create a unified storage resource
- **Logical Volumes (LVs)**: Virtual partitions that can be resized dynamically

LVM offers significant benefits like:
- Resize volumes without downtime
- Add storage capacity on-the-fly
- Create snapshots for backup purposes
- Migrate data between physical disks without disruption

By encrypting LVs, you ensure data protection even if physical access to the disk is compromised.

### 3. Security & Hardening

#### AppArmor
A Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system that restricts program capabilities by confining applications to a limited set of resources. AppArmor profiles define what files a program can access and what operations it can perform, providing protection against vulnerabilities and exploits.

#### SSH (Secure Shell)
A cryptographic network protocol for secure remote administration:
- Configured on non-standard port `4242` to reduce automated scanning attacks
- Disabled root login to prevent brute force attempts on the most privileged account
- Implemented key-based authentication for stronger security than passwords
- Limited connection attempts to prevent brute force attacks

#### UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
A user-friendly interface for managing iptables firewall rules:
- Allows only essential ports (e.g., SSH on `4242`)
- Blocks unnecessary traffic to reduce attack surface
- Logs connection attempts for security monitoring
- Provides simple command syntax for firewall management

#### Password Policies
Implemented robust authentication requirements:
- Expiration: Forces regular password updates (every 30 days)
- Complexity: Requires uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters
- History: Prevents reuse of previous passwords
- Login attempt limits: Protects against brute force attacks

#### User & Group Management
Created a structured access control system:
- Custom users assigned to specific groups like `sudo` and `user42`
- Restricted sudo privileges with custom rules in `/etc/sudoers.d/`
- Implemented logging for all sudo commands
- Applied principle of least privilege across the system

### 4. Automation & Monitoring

#### Bash Scripting
Created `monitoring.sh` to track real-time metrics including:
- CPU usage and specifications
- RAM allocation and availability
- Disk space consumption
- Network statistics and active connections
- Last boot time and system uptime

#### Cron
The system's task scheduler that enables:
- Automated execution of monitoring script every 10 minutes
- Regular system maintenance without manual intervention
- Scheduled backups and updates
- Custom timing specifications for recurring tasks

### 5. Bonus: WordPress & Web Services

#### Web Stack Components
- **Lighttpd**: A lightweight, high-performance web server optimized for speed, efficiency, and minimal resource usage
- **MariaDB**: A community-developed fork of MySQL offering improved performance and additional features
- **PHP**: Server-side scripting language powering dynamic content generation
- **WordPress**: Content management system built on PHP and MySQL/MariaDB
- **LiteSpeed**: High-performance HTTP server and load balancer with integrated caching

## üîß Technologies & Tools

### Core System Commands

#### System Information
- `lscpu`: Displays detailed CPU architecture information including cores, threads, and cache
- `uname -a`: Shows kernel version, hostname, and system architecture
- `hostnamectl`: Manages system hostname and related settings
- `lsblk`: Lists block devices (hard drives, partitions, etc.) in a tree-format
- `df -h`: Reports filesystem disk space usage in human-readable format
- `vmstat`: Reports virtual memory statistics including processes, memory, paging, and CPU activity
- `ip link`: Shows network interfaces and their state

#### Text Processing
- `wc`: Counts lines, words, and characters in files
- `awk`: Powerful text processing tool for data extraction and reporting
- `grep`: Searches for patterns in text and filters output

#### Service Management
- `systemctl`: Controls the systemd system and service manager
- `journalctl`: Queries and displays logs from journald

#### Network Analysis
- `ss`: Shows socket statistics (replaced netstat)
- `netstat`: Network statistics tool for connections and routing tables

### Security Frameworks

#### UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
UFW provides a simplified interface to the complex iptables firewall system. It uses a rule-based model where you can:
- Allow or deny traffic based on port numbers
- Restrict connections by IP address or subnet
- Create named application profiles
- Log firewall events for security analysis

#### SSH (Secure Shell)
SSH creates encrypted tunnels for secure remote administration. Key security features include:
- Custom port configuration to reduce automated scanning
- Disabling direct root login
- Key-based authentication
- Connection attempt limiting

#### MariaDB
A relational database management system that powers WordPress and other dynamic applications, with robust security configurations.

#### Cron
A time-based job scheduler in Unix-like systems for automating recurring tasks.

## üóÇÔ∏è System Architecture & Folder Structure

### Key System Directories
- **/boot**: Contains kernel images and bootloader configuration
- **/etc**: Stores system-wide configuration files
  - `/etc/ssh/`: SSH server and client configurations
  - `/etc/ufw/`: Firewall rules and settings
  - `/etc/cron.d/`: System cron jobs
  - `/etc/passwd`: User account information
  - `/etc/sudoers.d/`: Custom sudo permissions
- **/var**: Houses variable data files
  - `/var/log/`: System logs including sudo operations
  - `/var/www/html/`: Web server document root
  - `/var/lib/mysql/`: MariaDB database files
- **/bin** & **/sbin**: Essential binaries and system administration tools
- **/home**: User home directories with personal files and configurations

### Logical Volume Structure
- **System Volume**: Contains root filesystem
- **Home Volume**: Separate storage for user data
- **Var Volume**: Isolated space for logs and web content
- **Swap Volume**: Virtual memory extension

## üõë Challenges and Learnings

Throughout this project, I encountered and overcame several technical challenges including LVM encryption implementation, SSH hardening, firewall configuration, creating persistent monitoring solutions, and securing database access. Each challenge presented unique learning opportunities and led to deeper understanding of Linux system administration.

## üìö Skills Acquired

This project has provided a comprehensive foundation in enterprise-level server administration. Key skills developed include:

- **Security Implementation**: Creating defense-in-depth strategies with multiple security layers, implementing least-privilege access control, and enforcing strong authentication.

- **System Administration**: Managing packages, configuring services, monitoring system health, and performing routine maintenance tasks.

- **Network Management**: Setting up secure remote access, configuring firewalls, and implementing proper network isolation.

- **Automation**: Developing scripts for system monitoring and maintenance, scheduling recurring tasks, and creating efficient workflows.

- **Service Deployment**: Configuring web servers, databases, and application environments securely and efficiently.

This hands-on experience has demonstrated the interconnected nature of various system components and the importance of holistic security approaches in Linux environments.
