## üåü Key Concepts Explored

<hr>

### üñ•Ô∏è Virtual Machines (VMs)
A VM simulates a computer within your physical machine, allowing you to run isolated operating systems. Using **VirtualBox** to create a Debian VM teaches how hypervisors allocate resources (CPU, RAM, storage) between the host (physical machine) and guest (VM). Key advantages:
- Run multiple OS environments simultaneously
- Safely test configurations without affecting the host
- Efficiently share hardware resources

### üî™ LVM (Logical Volume Manager)
LVM abstracts storage management, enabling flexible disk allocation beyond traditional partitioning:

- **Physical Volumes (PVs)**: Raw storage devices (disks or partitions)
- **Volume Groups (VGs)**: Pools of PVs that create a unified storage resource
- **Logical Volumes (LVs)**: Virtual partitions that can be resized dynamically

By encrypting LVs, you ensure data protection even if physical access to the disk is compromised.

### üõ†Ô∏è Sudo (Superuser Do)
Sudo is a powerful command-line utility that allows permitted users to execute commands as the superuser:

- **Fine-grained permissions** via custom rules in /etc/sudoers.d/
- **Password authentication** required for all sudo commands
- **Session logging** to /var/log/auth.log for audit trails

### üì¶ APT vs Aptitude
Both APT (Advanced Package Tool) and Aptitude are package management tools for Debian-based systems:

- **APT:** Pure CLI tool ‚Ä¢ Uses apt-get/apt commands for basic operations
- **Aptitude:** Hybrid CLI/TUI ‚Ä¢ Interactive interface with keyboard navigation
- **APT:** Minimal dependency resolution ‚Ä¢ Fails on complex conflicts
- **Aptitude:** Smart solver ‚Ä¢ Auto-suggests dependency fixes

### üñ•Ô∏è Why No GUI?
Designed for efficiency and hardening:

- **Resource conservation:** Saves CPU/RAM for critical services
- **CLI mastery:** Forces hands-on Linux sysadmin skill development
- **Headless optimization:** Aligns with server/VM best practices
- **SSH compatibility:** Streamlines remote management workflows

### Security & Hardening

#### üõ°Ô∏è AppArmor
A Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system that restricts program capabilities by confining applications to a limited set of resources. AppArmor profiles define what files a program can access and what operations it can perform, providing protection against vulnerabilities and exploits.

#### üîê SSH (Secure Shell)
A cryptographic network protocol for secure remote administration:
- Configured on non-standard port `4242` to reduce automated scanning attacks
- Disabled root login to prevent brute force attempts on the most privileged account
- Implemented key-based authentication for stronger security than passwords
- Limited connection attempts to prevent brute force attacks

#### üß± UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
A user-friendly interface for managing iptables firewall rules:
- Allows only essential ports (e.g., SSH on `4242`)
- Blocks unnecessary traffic to reduce attack surface
- Logs connection attempts for security monitoring
- Provides simple command syntax for firewall management

#### üîí Password Policies
Implemented robust authentication requirements:
- Expiration: Forces regular password updates (every 30 days)
- Complexity: Requires uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters
- History: Prevents reuse of previous passwords
- Login attempt limits: Protects against brute force attacks

#### üë• User & Group Management
Created a structured access control system:
- Custom users assigned to specific groups like `sudo` and `user42`
- Restricted sudo privileges with custom rules in `/etc/sudoers.d/`
- Implemented logging for all sudo commands
- Applied principle of least privilege across the system

### Automation & Monitoring

#### üìú Bash Scripting
Created `monitoring.sh` to track real-time metrics including:
- CPU usage and specifications
- RAM allocation and availability
- Disk space consumption
- Network statistics and active connections
- Last boot time and system uptime

#### ‚è≤Ô∏è Cron
The system's task scheduler that enables:
- Automated execution of monitoring script every 10 minutes
- Regular system maintenance without manual intervention
- Scheduled backups and updates
- Custom timing specifications for recurring tasks

### ‚≠ê Bonus: WordPress & Web Services

#### Web Stack Components
- **Lighttpd**: A lightweight, high-performance web server optimized for speed, efficiency, and minimal resource usage
- **MariaDB**: A community-developed fork of MySQL offering improved performance and additional features
- **PHP**: Server-side scripting language powering dynamic content generation
- **WordPress**: Content management system built on PHP and MySQL/MariaDB
- **LiteSpeed**: High-performance HTTP server and load balancer with integrated caching
